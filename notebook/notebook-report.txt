Summary

1. Analysis Report and insigts:
    - There are some observation on analyzing the data:
        - 75% of the emails are opened and rest are just gone to spam or bin
        - Out of 75% of the opened emails only 30% of them are meeting link clicked
        - And out of 30% of meeting link clicked there are approximately 4% of them not even opened there mails, that may be they 
          have auto mail as message on receiving an emails
        - Only 1% people are those that opened, clicked meeting link and responded
        - .39 correlation between opened and meeting link clicked shows that same 40% people click meeting link and negative 
          correlation between meeting and responded shows that they are people who responded but not clicked meeting link
        - 100% of IT_solutions_series mails, 100% email_series_marketing_analytics mails and 100% series_legal series mails are opened

2. model development process:
    - There are some insigts or observation on model development:
        - There is need of removing stopwords, stemmer, hi, hey, hello salutation and replace 10min to 10minute like that there may be more words 
        - I used TFIDF to replace the text data with there Term frequency so that we will give high value to more frequent words in the model
        - Converted the Series that is email_series through one hot encoder so that we give equal importance to each of the series equally
        - After that split data to train and test so that we can check accuracy of model on unseen data 
        - Tried from simple linear model where first thought was as we have very small data so its good to see how simple model behaves and 
          that gave a low result and its prcision is 50%  but buy recall is low and that we want it to be more to know click marketing campign to be sucessful
        - Its okay model and its recall is 60% but precision is 53 and its prediction is 68% accurate
        - Tried more complex model SVG, KNN, XGBoost but nothing worked more good then just simple linear and Decision tree model


Key finding, Actionable and Improvement:
    - We can do IT solution, marketing analytics and legal email more as its click ratio is 100%
    - Only 1% people are responding that is very big issue as the user base is small of 150
    - Need to increase userbase 
    - Need to increase data and some more features 
    - There are many short words in the body and subject so we can remove them to improve the accuracy and decrease the size of model
    - I augument model data using small small changes but i felt like keeping the original for now
    - Model new more data to accuratly predict and reply and we need more features like date, time spend etc to add to the dataset



I hope the above information is useful.
